## Notes

I enjoyed refreshing my memory on how to make buttons work and the logic behind them, i.e., using the deleteChildElements function. Second, there were a few operators and functions that I have not had previous experience with that I had to do further reading and practice code.

Additionally, I would like to add a few more features:
(1) Working search bar using fuzzy search
(2) Responsive site that adjusts itself based on the user's screen
(3) Area to pledge money to a currently unfunded game with updates to the stats
